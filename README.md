# EduMPI GUI – Frontend 

**EduMPI GUI** is the graphical interface for [EduMPI](https://github.com/AnnaLena77/EduMPI),  
an Open MPI fork with integrated near-real-time performance measurement.  

The GUI provides students and educators with a **simple, intuitive way to run MPI applications on HPC clusters**  
and to **visualize communication patterns, performance metrics, and wait states** without prior knowledge of SSH, SLURM, or traditional profiling tools.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Simplified Cluster Access**
  - No SSH or SLURM scripting required  
  - Direct login via GUI  
  - Automatic file upload and job submission  

- **Job Management**
  - Select MPI executable and number of processes  
  - Start, monitor, and abort jobs interactively  
  - View job status in real-time  

- **Integrated Visualization**
  - **2D process view**: communication, bytes sent/received, wait times  
  - **3D cluster view**: processes as colored cubes on their physical nodes  
  - **Communication matrix**: direct process-to-process message analysis  
  - Interactive timeline navigation (per-second or interval-based)  

- **Educational Focus**
  - Helps students understand MPI behavior through visual cues  
  - Removes barriers of complex HPC toolchains  
  - Designed for classroom and lab exercises

## ⚙️ Architecture

The GUI acts as the **frontend client** in the EduMPI ecosystem:

1. Students launch the GUI (AppImage or local build)  
2. Login to the HPC cluster with provided credentials  
3. Select an MPI program and execution parameters  
4. EduMPI (cluster-side) executes the job and writes performance data to **TimescaleDB**  
5. The GUI queries aggregated data in near-real-time and visualizes results

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Download Prebuilt AppImage (Recommended)
1. Download the [EduMPI GUI AppImage](https://github.com/AnnaLena77/EduMPI_GUI_Download)  
2. Make it executable:  
   ```bash
   chmod +x EduMPI_GUI-x86_64.AppImage
   ```
3. run it:
   ```bash
    ./EduMPI_GUI-x86_64.AppImage
    ```

### Option 2: Build from Source
1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:AnnaLena77/EduMPI_GUI.git
    cd EduMPI_GUI
    ```
2. Install dependencies (Qt ≥ 6 recommended)
3. Build using CMake
4. Run the resulting binary

### Dev mode (local dev cluster)
For development against the local container cluster in the EduMPI repo (`dev/`), configure with
`-DEDUMPI_DEV_MODE=ON` (never used for release builds) and start the GUI from a shell where
`source <EduMPI>/dev/ssh/activate` was run. The GUI then reads the connection values from
`<EduMPI>/dev/gui.env`, connects to the database and the cluster automatically, reconnects every 5 s
after a restart of the dev cluster, and shows "[DEV]" in the window title. Without the flag or without
`EDUMPI_DEV_ENV` the GUI behaves as before. Details: `dev/README.md` in the EduMPI repo.

## 🔮 Future Work

- Improve ring buffer adaptivity to avoid overflow in micro-benchmarks  
- Extend support for additional MPI language bindings beyond C  
- Portable integration as an **independent framework** instead of Open MPI fork  
- Additional visualization dashboards (historical runs, anomaly detection)
